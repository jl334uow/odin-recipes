            <li>2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smokes paprika</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 shallots, peeled and cut in quarters</li>
            <li>1 pound small red potatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>2 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Toss the beef cubes with the flour, smoked paprika and salt and pepper, to coat well. Pour the olive oil into the non-stick inner pot of the rice cooker. Add the beef cubes to the pot along with the shallots, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, fresh thyme and fresh rosemary. Add the tomato paste, sugar, red wine and beef broth and stir well to combine the ingredients. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and stir again to disperse the seasoning.

                When the stew is finished cooking, taste the sauce and adjust the flavor by adding additional salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle the stew into bowls, garnish with freshly chopped parsley and serve.
